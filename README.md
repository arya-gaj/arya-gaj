I'm an aspiring Software Engineer & Product Designer from California, specializing in web development and graphic design. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs.

I'm also particularly passionate about AI engineering, with a strong interest in OpenCV, and have been building foundational projects using this technology.

My job is to build websites that are functional, user-friendly, and attractive. Moreover, I integrate AI-driven features and leverage advanced algorithms to ensure each product is not only eye-catching but also highly efficient. My aim is to convey your message and identity in the most innovative and creative way possible.
