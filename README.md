I am deeply focused on leveraging deep learning to support cognitive and emotional wellness — designing systems that understand, adapt to, and respond to the human mind with care and intelligence.

My current work explores how machine learning can interpret subtle patterns in speech, behavior, and visual cues to detect mental states, enhance emotional insight, and enable early intervention.

I believe that artificial intelligence, when developed ethically and empathetically, can be a powerful ally in mental health. From emotion-aware interfaces to neural pattern analysis and adaptive feedback systems, I am also driven by the potential of emerging technologies to build more mindful, inclusive, and emotionally intelligent digital experiences for people across the world.
